# Vex - Functional Programming Language
Vex is a memory safe purely functional programing language, with simple syntax for new users.

## Key Features
- **Memory Safety**: Vex eliminates common memory-related issues, such as null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows, ensuring that your applications run securely.
- **Purely Functional**: Emphasizing immutability and first-class functions, Vex encourages a functional programming paradigm that leads to more predictable and maintainable code.
- **Strong Type System**: Vex's strong static type system helps catch errors at compile time, reducing runtime issues and enhancing code reliability.

> Note: Vex is currently an experimental language. Expect changes to syntax, features, and tooling as development progresses.
